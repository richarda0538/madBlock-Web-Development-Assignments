		<h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
		Thanksgiving is a state of mind,<br/>
		It isn't a feast or a day;<br/>
		It's the joy you feel within your heart<br/>
		For blessings God sends your way.<br/>
		<br/>
		It's the knowledge that God is good,<br/>
		That His is a boundless supply;<br/>
		That you need but to ask in faith<br/>
		To make all your good multiply.<br/>
		<br/>
		Whenever you're prompted to praise<br/>
		As you kneel in the silence to pray â€”<br/>
		When joy and love call forth your thanks-<br/>
		You are proclaiming Thanksgiving Day.<br/>
