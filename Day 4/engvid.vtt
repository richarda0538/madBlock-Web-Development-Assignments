00:09.120 --> 00:09.840
if you

00:09.840 --> 00:14.799
can keep your head when all about you

00:14.799 --> 00:20.160
are losing theirs and blaming it on you

00:20.960 --> 00:24.560
if you can trust yourself when all men

00:24.560 --> 00:28.320
doubt you but make allowance

00:28.320 --> 00:31.840
for their doubting too

00:32.320 --> 00:36.000
if you can wait and not be tired by

00:36.000 --> 00:37.760
waiting

00:37.760 --> 00:40.879
or being lied about don't

00:40.879 --> 00:45.360
deal in lies or being hated

00:45.360 --> 00:48.800
don't give way to hating

00:48.800 --> 00:51.920
and yet don't look too good nor

00:51.920 --> 00:55.199
talk too wise

00:56.000 --> 01:00.239
if you can dream and not make dreams

01:00.239 --> 01:02.480
your master

01:02.480 --> 01:05.760
if you can think and not make thoughts

01:05.760 --> 01:08.400
your aim

01:08.400 --> 01:11.280
if you can meet with triumph and

01:11.280 --> 01:12.720
disaster

01:12.720 --> 01:15.520
and treat those two imposters just the

01:15.520 --> 01:17.840
same

01:18.400 --> 01:20.880
if you can bear to hear the truth you've

01:20.880 --> 01:22.320
spoken

01:22.320 --> 01:25.360
twisted by knaves to make a trap for

01:25.360 --> 01:27.360
fools

01:27.360 --> 01:30.560
or watch the things you gave your life

01:30.560 --> 01:31.759
to

01:31.759 --> 01:35.280
broken and stoop and build them up

01:35.280 --> 01:38.960
with worn out tools

01:39.360 --> 01:42.640
if you could make one heap of all your

01:42.640 --> 01:43.920
winnings

01:43.920 --> 01:46.960
and risk it on one turn of pitch and

01:46.960 --> 01:48.640
toss

01:48.640 --> 01:51.680
and lose and start again

01:51.680 --> 01:55.520
at your beginnings and never breathe a

01:55.520 --> 01:59.200
word about your loss

01:59.200 --> 02:02.320
if you can force your heart and nerve

02:02.320 --> 02:06.000
and sinew to serve your turn

02:06.000 --> 02:09.598
long after they are gone and so

02:09.598 --> 02:13.360
hold on when there is nothing in you

02:13.360 --> 02:17.200
except the will which says to them

02:17.200 --> 02:22.160
hold on if you can talk with crowds

02:22.160 --> 02:25.840
and keep your virtue or walk with

02:25.840 --> 02:31.120
kings nor lose the common touch

02:31.120 --> 02:34.160
if neither foes nor loving friends can

02:34.160 --> 02:37.360
hurt you if all men count

02:37.360 --> 02:41.840
with you but none too much

02:42.080 --> 02:45.280
if you can fill the unforgiving minute

02:45.280 --> 02:50.080
with 60 seconds worth of distance run

02:50.080 --> 02:53.840
yours is the earth and everything

02:53.840 --> 02:57.680
that's in it and

02:57.680 --> 03:02.000
which is more you'll be a man

03:02.000 --> 03:05.840
my son

03:19.599 --> 03:21.680
you
